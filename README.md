# Dropwizard Sample

This project is a sample app of me trying out different features and integrations for Dropwizard.  

## Ideal Integrations

* ~~Webjars integration to get Bootstrap and AngularJS working~~
* Google Guice to manage my Jersey Resource classes and dependencies
* Websocket integration for having a POC between this and an Angular ui.
* ~~Swagger integration for API documentation~~
* Deploy POC to Heroku
* Authentication (token-based?) and Angular login/logout forms
* JSON Vulnerability Protection (see http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/service/$http)
